- 👋 Hi, I’m @betterify. I strongly believe there is always a better way to do anything and everything. And in the same sense, there can be a better code. 
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and programming. I am new to coding and development. I have been trained in Finance, Accounts, and Taxation for 30 years. I have a special interest in coding and programming. At present, I am learning how to make good static sites. I wish to explore the whole serverless ecosystem. My special interest is in two SSGs - @gohugoio/hugo, and @github.com/withastro/astro). I love Netlify (@github.com/netlify) and Vercel (@github.com/vercel/vercel) for deployment.
- 🌱 I’m learning Github, Hugo, Astro, and Svelte. I am on the learning path of a new Stack called the Jamstack.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on SSGs and Jamstack. 
- 💞️ My special interests are Quantum Computers, Quantum Consciousness, Mindfulness, and Spirituality.
- 💡 Do I have a goal when it comes to Software Development? Oh, yes. My learning curve seems to be very challenging. I wish to move from No Stack to Jamstack to Full Stack!!
- 📫 You can always reach me at: avadhoot.dandekar@gmail.com.
