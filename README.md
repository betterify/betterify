- 👋 Hi, I’m @betterify. I strongly believe that there is always a better way to do anything and everything. And in the same sense there can be a better code. 
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and programming. I am new to coding and development. I am actually trained in Finance, Accounts, and Taxation for 30 years. I have a special interest in coding and programming. At present I am learning how to make good static sites. I want to explore the whole serverless ecosystem. My special interest as of now is in two SSGs - That is @gohugoio/hugo and @gatsbyjs/gatsby. I just love Netlify for deployment.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Github, Hugo, Gatsby, and Svelte. I am on the learning path of a new Stack called the Jamstack.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on SSGs and Jamstack. 
- 💞️ My special interests are: Quantum Computers, Quantum Consciousness, Mindfulness, and Spirituality.
- 📫 You can always reach me at: avadhoot.dandekar@gmail.com or avadhoot@bettermanagenow.com.
